# Finance Website

The idea for this project will be a personal finance website (I want to make it
usable, but simple), and the design will be inspired by similar websites (very
inspired by <a href="https://www.organizze.com.br/">Organizze</a> and <a
href="https://akaunting.com/">Akaunting</a>). 

## Disclaimer

Alright listen. If you read through the actual words on the website you'll see
it's kinda not serious. I understand it is not professional. This project is
mine alone, and it will never be used for any type of profit.

All this project does, is it shows that I can create a professional-looking
website and make it functional. But I will have fun in the process lol.
