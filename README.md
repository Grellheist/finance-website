# Finance Website

The idea for this project will be a personal finance website (I want to make it
usable, but simple), and the design will be inspired by similar websites (very
inspired by <a href="https://www.organizze.com.br/">Organizze</a> and <a
href="https://akaunting.com/">Akaunting</a>). 

## Disclaimer

Alright listen. If you read through the actual words on the website you'll see
it's kinda not serious. I understand it is not professional. This project is
mine alone, and it will never be used for any type of profit.

All this project does, is it shows that I can create a professional-looking
website and make it functional. But I will have fun in the process lol.

That being said, obviously the words written in this website in no way reflect
how I view reality, and any "advice" in this website should NOT be taken
serious (except the fact that you should invest your money, but please be
careful and know what you're doing).
